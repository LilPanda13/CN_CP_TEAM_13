% Array is a variable that consists of a set of numbers stored together
A = [8, 9, 10, 11]
% creates a simple array of 4 numbers
size (A)
% helps check the size of the array
length (A)
%% Q1.2: What is the difference between 'size' and 'length'
A (1)
% you can extract a specific element form an array by specifying its position, this is called an index
A (1:3)
% also extracts multiple elements
A (:)
% also extracts all
A (end)
% also extracts only the last one
A (2:end)
A (end-1:end)
% also extracts last two 
A = [8; 9; 10; 11]
% makes 4 rows instead of columns (use ',' for columns and ';' for rows)
A' 
% Transpose array (swapping rows and columns) with an apostrophe
[A; 4]
% Adds another row to A
%% Q1.3: What happens when you do [A, 4] instead of [A; 4]?
B = [8, 9, 10; 12, 13, 14, 15]
%% Q1.4: What is the size of B? What is its length?
C = [12; 13; 14; 15]
D = [A, C]
% To combine arrays into a larger array or matrix
%% Q1.5: What should you type to combine A and C into one single long array of 8 elements?
D (4, 2)
%% Q1.6: Which element did you get? What is its position in the matrix (row, column)? How can you get all the elements of the last 2 rows?
E = [10:20] 
F = [10:2:20]
% To create an array of elements ranging from one number all the way to another number use :
%% Q1.7: What is the difference between E and F? What does the middle 2 do?
%% Q1.8: Make an array G of [40 37 34 ... 22] by using the colon operator :
%% Q1.9: Build a 3x8 matrix with random numbers (try help rand)
clear A
% to clear out the workspace of a specific variable
% A struct is a data type in MATLAB that groups related data using data containers called fields. Each field can contain any type of data. Access data in a field using dot notation of the form.
ourdata.name = {'jan', 'piet', 'marie'}
ourdata.height = [173 201 165]
ourdata.weight = [64 95 24]
%% Q.1.10: Adda a fourth datapoint to the data struct ourdata with the name john, height 190 and weight 140. What if you type ourdata.name(3)?
name = {'jan'; 'piet'; 'marie'}
height = 173; 201; 165]
weight = [64; 95; 54]
myTable = table (name, height, weight 'VariableNames', {'name', 'height', 'weight'})
% To access valyes in a table use their named index and numerical index
myTable.height
myTable ([2:3],:)
tallPeople = height > 190;
myTable (tallPeople,:)
% To add a new subject (row) or feature (column) to our table by making a new table and then adding it to our existing table:
T2 = table ({'john'}, 190, 120, 'VariableNames', {'name', 'height', 'weight'})
myTable = [myTable;T2]
% Can also add by defining a new variable in the table directly
myTable.BMI = (myTable.weight)./((myTable.height/100).^2);
10 + 11
a + 10
A * 10
Q1.11: What does * do? How can you divide an array by a number?
% just * and / do matrix multiplication and a tupe of matrix division, instead use .* and ./ for pairwise multiplication and division.
A2 = A - 10
%% Q1.12: What is the difference between the above command the below 
A2 = A - [10;9;8;6]
%% Q1:13: What do you get when you input two arrays?
A - C
%% Q1.14: What do you get when you do A - B, and why?
10 == 11
% a single equal is to assign a number to a variable, a double is used to evaluate if they are the same
X = 11 > 10
% can also store the output of this operation, a > b tests if a is larger than b, b;a < b tests if a is smaller than b and >= and <= test...
B == 9
% To ask if a matrix contains a certain value
%% Q1.15: What do you get as an answer?
strcmp (a,b) 
% is used to check if two string variable are similar 
a = 'this is a string of text'
b = 'this is a strong of text'
c = 'string'
strcmp (a, b)
strcmp (a, c)
% Boolean operations can be used for if...then...else construction
if BOOLEAN
...
else
...
end
% for example:
y = 5
if y == 10
disp (y)
else
disp ('too bad: y is not 10')
end
% another example:
y = 5
if y == 10
dis ('YES! y is equal to 10')
elseif y == 5
dis ('COOL! y is equal to 5')
else
disp ('too bad: y is not 5 nor 10')
end
% For-Loop is used to perform the same operations on a set of elements repeatedly
for i = 1:10
...
end
% example
for i = 1:10
disp (i)
end
% example
a = 3;
b = 8;
c = 0;
for i = a:b
disp (a+c);
c = c + 1;
end
% for-loop can be used for an array and perform an operation on each of the elements.
z = [2:11]
for i = 1:length(z)
zout (i) = z(i) * 10;
end
%% Q1.17: Why don't you see anything? What is the output of this loop?
%% Q1.18: What happens when you change the loop to:
for i = 1:length (z)
Z(i) = Z(i) * 10;
end
% while-loop can be run as long as a certain condition is true.
a = 5
while a == 5
disp ('running')
end
% to kill a command, press CTRL + C
a = 0
while a < 10
disp (a);
a = a + 1
end
% this is a finite loop
%% Q1.19: Why is each number displayed twice? How to solve this?
% to write commands into script 
myscript.m

myfirstfunction.m
myfirstfunction (10)
% Functions can take multiple variables as input and include multiple lines of instructions
%% Q1.20: Write a script of all the code snippets from this tutorial.
%% Q1:21: Write a function that takes an integer (whole number) as an input and checks whether it is an odd or even number
% Hint: whats the difference in outcome between dividing an even number or an odd number by 2?
